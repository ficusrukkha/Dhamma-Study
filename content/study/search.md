This is how you find the text you wish to study:

### 1. "Inspire Me!"

If you don't know where to start, click the `Inspire Me!` button. This will trigger a random term from a collection of examples to be shown together with the corresponding results:

Clicking on the line of text with the arrow in the results field will show the Suttas that have the relevant search term:

Clicking on one of the Suttas in the results list will show the search term in the context of its text segment:

On this level you can already compare, whether or not a given term occurs always in the same context.

Clicking on the arrow underneath a segment takes you to the corresponding Sutta.

### 2. Typing into the search field

If you are searching for a particular topic, start typing a word that you remember from the context into the search box. Let's assume for example that you sish to find one of the similes about water. Type "water" and select from the search terms that pop up.

You can also search Suttas by ID, fo rexample "AN 10.61". In languages that are not completely translated, if you search for a Sutta that has no segmented translation in your selected language Bhante Sujato's English translation will be shown.

Free text search is  not supported on EBT-Site. If you enter a search string that does not correspond to an examples term, you will be pointed to Voice.suttacentral.net.

### 3. Going to neighboring Suttas or to SuttaCentral

At the bottom of the page you find links to the previous and next Suttas in the order of the canon. In the middle there is a link to the corresponding Sutta on SuttaCentral.

### 4. Unsing the results history

It is easy to go back to your previous Sutta on EBT-Site. You can see the history in the bottom navigation bar. In the middle you see the segment last clicked on of your current Sutta, at the left is the Sutta you have last come from, and at the right is the Sutta to which you have previously been going from your current place.

EBT-Site remembers a longer search history. On hovering your mouse over the left or right history links, you see more Suttas in the order in which you have visited them.

Next to this "long term memory", the EBT-Site history also has a "short term memory". Each new Sutta that you visit, in which you click or play a segment, is marked with a pin. This way its position in the history is moved to the front. This makes it easier to switch between Suttas that are already in the history on a later place. The pins remain for 24 hours.

**Please note:** You need to activate cookies for the history features to work. In order to clear the history, disable cookies and refresh the page.

### 5. Going to individual segments

Clicking on a segment will highlight it.

At the same time the segment ID appears in the middle of the bottom navigation bar (see screen shot under "history"). By clicking it, you can go back to the segment last highlighted from any place in the text.

The segment last highlighted will still be highlighted when you come back to this text after visiting another Sutta. This makes it easy to look at another Sutta for comparison and on coming back find the place you have been reading last.

On the right at the bottom navigation bar you still find buttons to go to the top or bottom of the page.

### 6. Search terms inside the text

The examples search terms used on EBT-Site are highlighted in the text where they occur. This makes it easy to find interesting terms inviting comparison between texts. The terms have links. Clicking them will take you to a results list with all Suttas that have this term, as described under "inspire Me!".

Sometimes a quick look at other occurrances of the term is enough, and the segment button at the bottom will swiftly take you back to the place where you have been. Sometimes you might like to look at another Sutta in more detail. In that case too you fill quickly find back you original text with the help of the history.

This way, on EBT-Site you can fly through the Suttas! üê¶
