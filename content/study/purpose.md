### A website for two purposes
EBT-Site has been designed to serve two different needs: supporting Sutta study on one hand, and on the other hand offering a framework for building one's own EBT based website, customized for example for personal study needs, for a local Dhamma group, etc., without requiring much programming skills. Find detailed instructions [here](/author/build-site).

### Thoughts behind the Sutta study approach of EBT-Site
The Buddhist canon has quite a complex structure, and usually this is what most websites that present the Suttas are following. For newcomers it is sometimes not easy to find their way around in this structure. Therefore the thought arose to offer another approach for Sutta study. This is the aim behind the development of EBT-Site.

EBT-Site indexes the canon using key terms that can be found as example search terms via the "Inspire Me!" button. These key terms are also highlighted in the Sutta texts and invite you to compare different Suttas.

Imagine you are going for a walk in the forest: You walk along a path, and on your way you see a new signpost or something else that catches your curiosity. You decide to follow this hint and discover something new. Sometimes you may also find yourself unexpectedly at a place that is familiar; not so frequently in the beginning, but over time this happens more often. This way you will be very familiar with the area after a while.

Read [here](/wiki/study) how to get to know the Suttas better.

### Audio feature
EBT-Site comes with an audio feature that is similar to that of [Voice.suttacentral.net](https://voice.suttacentral.net). So you can both *read* the Suttas and *listen* to them! Read [here](/study/listening) how it works.

### Content
EBT-Site hosts Sutta root texts in Pali and segmented translations in English, German, Japanese, and hopefully soon in more languages. While Bhante Sujato's English translations are basically completed, other translation projects are still ongoing, and new texts are added as they are published.

### Differences between EBT-Site, SuttaCentral, and Voice.suttacentral.net
All three websites, [SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net), [Voice](https://voice.suttacentral.net), and EBT-Site, are using the [same data repository](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data) for the Suttas and therefore can access the same texts. The Sutta [AN 10.61](/suttas?search=an10.61%2Fen) for example, "Ignorance", can be found on all three websites. But the approaches of the sites are different, therefore they are more suited for different purposes, respectively.

Following are a few remarks on the differences between the websites.

Unlike EBT-Site, SuttaCentral is much more comprehensive. Its aim is to show all existing early Buddhist texts as completely as possible. Next to the root of the Pali tradition it also has texts that have been transmitted in Chinese translation or in other languages like Sanskrit, Tibetan, etc. For those who wish to study the parallels between these versions, SuttaCentral is the place to go. SuttaCentral also hosts more translations into many modern languages that have not been segmented and therefore cannot be shown on EBT-Site (legacy translations).

As for some people this abundance is just too overwhelming, the scope of EBT-Site is very much restricted in comparison. It only hosts root texts from one single transmission tradition, the Pali canon, and a consistent set of translations per language, and this way has a much slimmer and clearer structure. Technically, it is limited at [segmented texts](https://sc-voice.github.io/sc-voice/en/201-segmentation) only. Also, EBT-Site is at present confined to only one of the three "baskets" of the Pali canon, the Suttas (the discourses). The Vinaya (the monastic law) and the Abhidhamma (the systematic treatises) are not included.

Just to give an example for the differences: If you search for "root of suffering" on SuttaCentral, the site returns 11,793 results; on EBT-Site you get seven.

Voice.suttacentral.net has a similarly restricted approach as EBT-Site and shows the same segmented translations into modern languages. Voice has been developed for blind and visually disabled users, and next to a reduced content it also has a very minimalist user interface, meant to be easily accessible for screen reader users. For sighted people this feels often a bit too spartan. The audio feature is the central feature of Voice, so that the Suttas can be experienced by those who find reading difficult.

EBT-Site is trying a middle way as to user friendliness for readers and listeners. The light background color feels friendlier to sighted people, compared to the black background of Voice, and at the same time is not as straining for the eyes of visually disabled people as a plain bright white. For the audio feature, there is no separate audio player as in Voice, but the audio is played directly in the text segment. This makes it much easier to control which part of the text should be played.

These are just a few points to compare the three websites. It is up to you to find out what suits you best.
