### Listen to a Sutta by using the keyboard
Touch or click a segment in a sutta to highlight it.
Once highlighted, you will be able to use your keyboard to select and play 
any segment of a sutta using your keyboard.

EBT-Site has some functions that can be addressed by using the keyboard instead of the mouse. 
This helps, among others, vision disabled users.
- <kbd>SPACEBAR</kbd> : Play/pause the segment currently highlighted by the cursor. Double-tap the spacebar to play until the end of the sutta.

- <kbd>ENTER</kbd> : Start continuous play from the segment currently highlighted by the cursor onwards
- <kbd>ARROW UP</kbd> : Select previous segment 
- <kbd>ARROW DOWN</kbd> : Select next segment
