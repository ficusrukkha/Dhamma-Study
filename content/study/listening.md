Intermittant play: When clicking on a text segment, this can be played by clicking the play button. At the end of the segment, the cursor moves to the next segment. Click the play button again or press the space bar in order to continue.

Continuous play: Double click on the play button. EBT-Site will start playing from the segment where the cursor currently is. From here the Sutta will be played to the end. During continuous play you can click on another segment, and after finishing the current one, play will continue from the segment you have clicked. At the end of the Sutta, a bell sound is displayed according to your setting.

The EBT-Site audio function uses HTML5 audio, a new tecnology not yet used by [Voice.suttacentral.net](https://voice.suttacentral.net). The listening experience is much more direct, as time for loading the audio isn't required. Most browsers support HTML5 audio, an exception being Internet Explorer. If your browser doesn't support the EBT-Site audio function, try Chrome or Firefox.
