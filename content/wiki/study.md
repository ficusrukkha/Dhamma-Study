### Getting to know the Suttas
EBT-Site has various features to help you familiarize yourself with the early discourses.

Designed for studying the Suttas, the website indexes the canon using key terms that represent important doctrinal themes and other notable features of the texts. This type of approach helps train the memory and makes it easier to remember key passages.

EBT-Site allows you to jump back and forth very quickly between texts you want to compare, without losing focus of the original text.

EBT-Site also has an audio feature for listening to the Suttas.

Click on the magnifying glass on the top right to go to the Suttas.
