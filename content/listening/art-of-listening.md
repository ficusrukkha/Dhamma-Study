### Publisher's Summary

Publisher's Summary
The Dīghanikāya or Long Discourses of the Buddha is one of the four major collections of teachings from the early period of Buddhism. Its 34 suttas (in Sanskrit, sutras) demonstrate remarkable breadth in both content and style, forming a comprehensive collection. The Art of Listening gives an introduction to the Dīghanikāya and demonstrates the historical, cultural, and spiritual insights that emerge when we view the Buddhist suttas as oral literature.

Each sutta of the Dīghanikāya is a paced, rhythmic composition that evolved and passed inter-generationally through chanting. For hundreds of years, these timeless teachings were never written down. Examining 12 suttas of the Dīghanikāya, scholar Sarah Shaw combines a literary approach and a personal one, based on her experiences carefully studying, hearing, and chanting the texts. At once sophisticated and companionable, The Art of Listening will introduce you to the diversity and beauty of the early Buddhist suttas.

### What is the oral literature and how does it work?
Dr. Shaw explores the critically important role of _listening_ in 
the study of the suttas and the Digha Nikaya in particular.
She invites us to study the suttas directly from the vantage of their original context
rather than simply nod at the historical relevance of the "oral tradition."
In _The Art of Listening_ Dr. Shaw presents a compelling insight into
the importance of listening and reciting. 

Indeed, the Buddha himself
emphasized listening, and it is only our Western minds that have glossed over that
instruction with our modern inclination to read and to glean.
The eyes glance and glean. The ears hear.


> [AN4.147:1.1](suttas/#an4.147:1.1):   
> “Mendicants, when these four times are rightly developed and progressed, they gradually lead to the ending of defilements.  
>  
> What four?  
>  
> A time for listening to the teaching, a time for discussing the teaching, a time for serenity, and a time for discernment.  
> It’s like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean.  
>  
> In the same way, when these four times are rightly developed and progressed, they gradually lead to the ending of defilements.”
